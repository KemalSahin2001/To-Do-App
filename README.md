### Explanation of Changes

1. **Correct Image Path**: The path to your image is now `todo_app/tests/img/gui.png`. Ensure that this matches your repository structure exactly as GitHub is case-sensitive and path-sensitive.

2. **Contact Information**: Updated with your email address for feedback and questions.

3. **GitHub Repository URL**: Updated to `https://github.com/KemalSahin2001/To-Do-App.git` for accurate clone instructions.

4. **Name and Profile**: Personalized with your GitHub profile link and name.

### Steps to Finalize

1. **Check Image Path**: Double-check that the `gui.png` image path matches exactly in the repository. If the path is different, adjust accordingly.

2. **Push `README.md` to GitHub**: Once you've ensured all paths are correct, push your changes to GitHub.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README.md with project details and image"
git push
```

### Verify on GitHub

1. **Navigate to Your GitHub Repository**: [To-Do-App on GitHub](https://github.com/KemalSahin2001/To-Do-App)
2. **Check the `README.md` Rendering**: Ensure that the image displays correctly and all links work as expected.
3. **Review**: Look for any issues with formatting or content that you might want to refine further.

### Conclusion

Your project now has a well-documented `README.md` that outlines its features, setup instructions, and usage. This not only makes it easier for others to understand and use your application but also encourages contributions.
